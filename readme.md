This project enables content creators and educators to mint, sell, and earn royalties from NFT-based study aids. Each NFT represents a unique digital resource (such as flashcards, study guides, or video tutorials) that can be sold on the blockchain. Through embedded royalty mechanisms, creators continue to earn a percentage of revenue every time their NFTs are resold.
